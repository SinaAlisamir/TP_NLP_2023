    "# Machine learning for acoustic signals and text\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical work provides an introduction to the basics of machine learning (ML) applied to acoustic signals and text using Python. ML refers to a set of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that learn to perform a task using data. The type of data used is usually referred to as the modality used for ML. Here we will be working with audio (specifically acoustic signals) and text, and the tasks considered here are sentiment classification from text, emotion classification from acoustic signals, and gender classification for acoustic signals. To perform an ML task from different input modalities, there are traditionally several stages involved, which are shown below [(Hüffmeier et al. 2020)](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/An-Overview-of-the-Steps-That-Compose-the-Machine-Learning-Process-adopted-from-13_fig4_348446831):\n",

    "#### Extracting features (Exercise 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the objectice is to extract useful audio features for ML. `mel filter-banks` and `mfcc` features are the two widly used traditional feature extraction techniques that are still popular today, due to their effectiveness and low computational requirements ([learn more here](https://haythamfayek.com/2016/04/21/speech-processing-for-machine-learning.html)). Such features are calculated for low periods of time (about 25 ms) where an acoustic signal is considered to be statistically stationary. Thus, you will have a different size of feature set for each audio file, with a different length. This is problematic for many machine learning approaches as the input needs to have a fixed length. This is traditionally addressed by averaging the features over time. However, averaging is only one way of statistically representing data. In order to better represent the set of acoustic features for an uttered phrase, here we would like to also use standard deviation `std`, in addition to the average `mean`. Here is a summary of your tasks for this exercise:\n",

    "Now that we've defined our metrics, let's quickly train a model on some of our data to see what can be done and how. Different ML models can be used to map a set of features to a set of classes or labels. Here we want to use `SVC` from the `sklearn` package to do `SVM` classification. SVMs are one of the best-known ML methods, conceived about 30 years ago, but still in use today. Basic SVMs learn to separate two classes by a hyperplane in the space of features. This hyperplane separator is trained to be the optimal separator of different classes, taking into account all the training features. This hyperplane separator is considered linear in the first implementations of SVMs (see figure below), but our input features are not always linearly separable. Therefore, a mathematical kernel mechanism was soon introduced to transform the linear hyperplane into a higher dimensional space where the input features are better separable.\n",

A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a fully connected class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), and the term MLP often loosely means any feedforward ANN [taken from its wiki here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron). ANNs are a type of machine learning technique, which is loosely based on the concept of biological neural networks in the human brain. Each artificial neuron, similar to the synapses and axons of a biological neuron, can be connected to other neurons to send or receive information. Artificial neurons are usually put together as groups, which are called neural layers. The most basic form of artificial neural layers, are fully connected layers, where all the neurons of the first layer is connected to all the neurons of the next layers. To describe how fully connected layers work through mathematical notations, we can consider the input of each layer to be a numerical vector, that is transformed to a different vector, through a matrix multiplication, and usually followed by a non-linear function. This process can be written as followed: \n",

You learned how to load different acoustic and textual datasets into memory, process them, and parition them if necessary, and extract effective features from them. You then learnt how to use these features in various state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to train accurate models that can predict the mood, gender and emotions of different people. You also learnt how to optimise the hyper-parameters of a machine learning model and how to evaluate them after training. The practical knowledge gained in this practical work, can be used to effectively model a large number of acoustic tasks (such as speech recognition, speaker recognition, emotion recognition, language identification) and a large number of textual tasks (such as text classification, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and natural language processing)."
